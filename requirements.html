<h3>Hardware</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Raspberry Pi 5 - 8 GB</li>
  <li>SD Card - 128 GB</li>
  <li>Raspberry Pi High Quality HQ Camera (12MP)</li>
  <li>16mm 10MP Telephoto Lens for Raspberry Pi HQ Camera (10MP)</li>
  <li>Adafruit 1.3" Color TFT Bonnet for Raspberry Pi - 240x240 TFT + Joystick Add-on</li>
  <li>3-D printed housing and mount</li>
  <li>Portable, Type-C Power Source (5V)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Assumptions</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>The system has a charged, stable power supply.</li>
  <li>The system's components are properly plugged in and installed into the housing.</li>
  <li>The systemâ€™s camera and lens are properly mounted on the device and telescope.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Software</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Bookworm OS</li>
  <li>Astrometry.net Local Installation<ul>
      <li>Install index files to directory</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Python Modules<ul>
      <li><i>Starplot</i> and <i>Skyfield</i> are key Python libraries for the project, as they allow us to manage targets and render OpticPlots, which emulate what a telescope would see. This will be used on the device to display what should be currently visible through the eyepiece.</li>
      <li><i>Picamera2</i> is used to dynamically control capture settings and take images.</li>
      <li><i>Pillow</i> is used throughout the project for general image manipulation and display.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Assumptions</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Camera can be controlled precisely, including capturing images and setting parameters such as exposure and gain.</li>
  <li>Solver is properly setup and configured to camera (pixel scale, downsample rate, etc.)</li>
  <li>Astrometry.net index files are correct and provide accurate solve information.</li>
  <li>Optic Plots generated by Starplot are accurate and closely represent what would be seen through the scope.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Environment</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li>User must have a working telescope with a sliding dovetail rail, common for most finderscopes, to mount device.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Assumptions</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>The system will be attached to a telescope.</li>
  <li>The system will operate under clear skies with minimal cloud cover.</li>
  <li>The system's camera will be minimally blocked and have a good view of the sky.</li>
</ul>
