<p>Contains hardware specific implementation of device functionality through a <i>1.3" TFT Bonnet screen for a Raspberry Pi.</i>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This screen is 240x240 pixels, and the header board also has a joystick(with click-in button) and two other buttons. This contains specific setup of hardware, including accessing the board, setting up the screen, and creating a system for using and rendering interfaces. This functionality was split into four classes:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Display - Handles image rendering of all UIs</li>
  <li>Input - Handles input from the joysticks and buttons</li>
  <li>Screen - Handles physically setting up screen and buttons, and rendering images</li>
  <li>UI(Manager) - Manages current state, changing how inputs work and what is rendered</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
